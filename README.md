# Diabetic-Retinopathy
Diabetic Retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects the eyes. It is caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). Early on, diabetic retinopathy may cause no symptoms or only mild vision problems, but it can lead to blindness if left untreated.
